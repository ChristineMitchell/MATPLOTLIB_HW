## Overview:
Pyber wants to improve ride sharing services and affordability for underserved neighborhoods, hence I have been tasked with providing a summary table that encompasses the total rides, total drivers, and total fares for urban, suburban and rural communities. As well, it includes the average fare per ride and average fare by driver for these areas. Lastly, I will provide a point-in-time snapshot of the total fares aggregated by week in a line chart so that we can identify the fare disparities between the different city types.

## Results:
There are certainly more opportunities in urban communities for rides, however the volume of drivers outnumber the ride opportunities by 48%. We already see that the average fare per ride in urban areas is only $24.53 compared to $30.97 and $34.62 for suburban and rural communities, respectively. This makes the average urban fare per driver drop to $16.57. While we see the opposite happening in the rural areas. Ride opportunities in rural communities literally make up 5.3% of all the ride opportunities. But the thing we need to consider is that while there are fewer rides needed, there are even fewer drivers available to meet the rural demand. As seen before the average fare per ride is $34.62 in rural communities. Given, in part, this could be attributed to a greater accumulated mileage for a rural ride compared to an urban ride, but the inferred reason for this is that there are simply fewer drivers available. There are 1.6x the rural ride opportunities to rural drivers and this is reflected in the average rural fare per driver reaching $55.49. That is 3.3x more than in urban areas and even 1.4x more than the suburban areas.

Of course, we still need to consider that the greatest fare opportunities remain in the urban area in which 63% of the total fares are from urban communities aligning with them having 68.4% of the ride opportunities. Then, 30% of the total fares are suburban which correlates to the 26.3% of the total ride opportunities being suburban. That leaves 7% of the total fares being rural lining up with the respective 5% of total rides being rural.

The chart above provides a snapshot of the volume of aggregated weekly fare totals for city type from January, 2019 through April, 2019. It clearly demonstrates how there are more fares comings out of the urban cities, then the suburbs, and lastly the rural communities. The chart shows a similar pattern week over week for the different city types through the end of February, where they all saw a spike for the week ending February 24th. It would be wise to research that week and see what may have driven that spike in all city types. Anyhow, they all took on their own fluctuations in March and April. The urban cities had peaks and valleys week to week through March, then plateaued in April. March was fairly smooth for the suburban communities, then in April took a dip before having a steady rise. Then, the rural areas remained fairly flat throughout March and April, with one peak in the first week of April.

## Recommendations:

I would suggest that Pyber provide me with more information to provide a proper analysis. I agree that it is important to look at the three components and how they affect one another: total drivers, rides, and the fares. However, we need to consider two additional factors that impact the fares: total mileage and ride duration. For example, urban city rides may not accumulate a lot of mileage, but the time it takes to get through traffic can impact the fare. While rural rides may have an increased fare because they have to cover a lot of mileage, which impacts their time and fuel consumption, but also impacts the basic wear and tear on the driver's vehicle. They may even have to account for tolls that they pass back to the customer. While suburban rides may need to account for any combination of the above. 

If Pyber looks at the overall demand and greatest fare generator, they can maintain the status quo since urban cities account for 68.4% of the ride opportunities, generating 63% of the fare totals.  It is important that they not lose market share in the urban cities. However, if they want to be efficient, they may revisit the number of drivers dedicated to the urban cities and calculate the optimal amount of drivers necessary to maintain their urban market share and meet the needs of their business. 

Of course, as visionaries, they can consider additional options to the status quou: 

We know that the rural areas are in need of dedicated drivers to meet the demands of their community. They could expand their Pyber footprint by serving the rural community. This could be a win-win investment for the company and the customers. By hiring more rural drivers, or incenting transfers from urban to rural communities, Pyber could make more drivers available to rural customers. This increased supply of drivers may not only increase availability but drive down the fare per ride making it more affordable for this underserved rural community. This investment may incent customers to call on Pyber more frequently as they become more reliable, accessible, and affordable.

Pyber could continue to expand their marketing in the urban cities to not simply maintain their marketshare but grow their urban marketshare and drive up the demand of ride opportunities. They can establish incentives to drive in more customers like a referral program, reduced fare after 10 rides promotion, or designated driver promotions for those "roaring 20's post pandemeic celebrations."

Lastly, Pyber needs to branch out and consider the aging population in all communities to meet the ever growing needs of this demographic. As people age, they often become more reliant on others to get them to and fro, yet they want to maintain their independence.  So they may opt for ride share services to get to places like the market, hair appointment, or increased medical appointments. It may be prudent to pull data on age demographics and how to market to this group by city type.
